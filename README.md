# Timer...?

I thought of to make it when I saw the clock of the `Tmux`, well, that one was difficult than I thought but the way I solved it was better than the last one.

You can run it compiling manually, or, if you are in a Unix based system and have `gcc` you can run it with the script "exec.sh", like that: `sh exec.sh` or `./exec.sh`\
 
### Self assessment
As I said, this one was better than the last one, and I could notice that I don't know how to manage pointers as well as I thought. Note: 8. It was very instructive.
